Cy7C68013 Firmware.

Simple starting firmware for Nitro boards that use the FX2 and USB drivers for
the Nitrogen Data Acquisition System.

To start your own project, make your own firmware directory and copy the
Makefile from the firmware directory here to your directory.  Then, customize
the path to the sources to point back to these sources.  If you want to modify
these sources, copy them local and adjust your Makefile accordingly.

Change the FX2LIBDIR variable at the top of the Makefile to point back here 
correctly.

Change the VID/PID accordingly for your project.

Change the SDCCFLAGS to include appropriate directories for the handlers you
want to use in your firmware.

Customize your own handlers.c to include additional handlers for the board 
you are building.
